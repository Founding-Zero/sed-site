              Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government
              and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by
              introducing <strong>Social Environment Design</strong>, a general framework for the use of AI for automated
              policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities. 
              The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and gives a 
              direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We highlight
              key open problems for future research in AI-based policymaking. By solving these challenges, we hope to achieve 
              various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Introduction</h2>
        <div>  Economic policy formulation is a domain fraught with complexity, with traditional economic models providing limited 
          foresight into the outcomes of policy decisions. Policy-makers must not only understand the immediate implications 
          of individual policies but also their aggregate and long-term effects. In addition, human policy-maker incentives 
          are often not aligned with the interests of the general public, and may instead prioritize special interests or 
          reelection. In light of this, AI-based approaches to policy design that can simulate economies and target different 
          objectives, hold the potential for improved policy understanding and formulation.</div>

        <div>Figure 1: The proposed framework. The process begins with voting, where human or AI players report preferences on social welfare objectives to a 
          voting mechanism (1). This defines an objective for the Principal, who designs a parameterized ùëÅ-player Partially Observable Markov Game. 
          The players are the same as the voters. This POMG unfolds over several timesteps ùëá. Following the POMG, game state information is extracted
           to initiate a new round of voting, with the last POMG state used as the first game state of the new round. This whole process is repeated for 
          ùúè timesteps.</div>

          In an era where AI is gaining increasing attention in governments, it is timely to understand its potential influence on future policy-making. Ideally, such a framework should satisfy the following desiderata:
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Alignment of policy-makers</strong> to the values of constituents, whilst ensuring fair and equitable representation.</li>
          <li>Sufficient<strong> model expressivity</strong> to accurately represent the intricate governance structures found in the real world, capturing the subtleties and variances of socio-economic interactions.</li>
          <li>Balance expressiveness with <strong> with computational tractability</strong>, making it feasible to scale to systems with a large number of agents.</li>
          <li>Build<strong> theoretical understanding,</strong> enabling systematic analysis and offering a new lens on complex economic models.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>
          Our work proposes a new framework, Social Environment Design, that lays out an agenda in making progress towards these desiderata. 
          In our framework, illustrated in the figure above, we suggest addressing the concern of a misaligned policy-maker an AI-driven Principal policy-maker 
          who seeks to achieve suggested policy goals, given by a voting mechanism. We capture the complexity of a general economic environment
          whilst maintaining computational tractability by modeling the economy as a Partially Observable Markov Game (POMG), which maintains a fixed 
          observation space for each agent. Finally, we structure our framework as repeatedly finding Stackelberg Equilbria, enabling theoretical understanding 
          by allowing reduction to simpler subproblems.

            totals of all the players‚Äô cumulative extrinsic rewards, where it collects tax and redistributes wealth on the cumulated rewards at
            the end of every tax period (50 timesteps), similar to Zheng et al. (2022). Rewards for the Principal are determined by the change
             in value of the objective it is currently assigned by agent votes.</div>

        <div>
          In order to give a motivating example for how preference elicitation for the principal in Social Environment Design can be used to align
          policy-maker incentives, we have created a Sequential Social Dilemma Game inspired by the Harvest Game proposed in Perolat et al. (2017). 
          The game is illustrated in Figure 2. The aim in Harvest Game is to collect apples, with each apple yielding a reward. If all apples in an 
          area are harvested, they never grow back. The dilemma arises when individual self-interest drives rapid harvesting, which could permanently 
          deplete resources. Thus, agents must sacrifice personal benefit and cooperate for collective well-being. One potential solution to this 
          dilemma is through the use of a central government that taxes and redistributes apples. Thus, we have created a new game inspired by 
          Zheng et al. (2022) in which a principal designs tax rates on apple collection and players vote on Utilitarian (productivity) vs. 
          Egalitarian (equality) objectives for the principal. As players interact within this evolving environment, the principal faces the challenge 
          of crafting policies that balance immediate economic incentives with sustainability goals. In order to achieve this, the principal must foster
          cooperation among players, guiding them towards the Pareto-Efficient equilibrium that the players have chosen. Preliminary results were promising,
           but further analysis is warranted.

      <div class="container is-max-desktop content">
        <h2 class="title is-3">Where Do We Go From Here?</h2>
        <div>  Our work proposes a generalized framework that has the potential to improve decision-making ‚Äî we
          believe that further work will yield tangibly impactful positive results. However, we recognize 
          that its current level of abstraction may obscure its ultimate potential and application. Our 
          motivating example, while useful as a proof of concept, is clearly distant from real-world economic 
          systems. While we recognize the distance, we posit that both a game where agents harvest apples and 
          the NYSE lie on the same fundamental axis. In fact, we outline two natural axes that separate our 
          example from societally impactful instantiations of SED in the future.
          <br><br>
          Our axes: <strong>Simulation Complexity</strong> and <strong>Principal Control</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first and more immediately apparent axis is the complexity of the simulation that the Principal 
              is parameterizing. One of the simplest instantiations of the simulation would be two independent agents 
              harvesting apples, each with the desire to have as many apples as possible. In this situation, an optimal 
              parameterization from the Principal might one that discourages overharvesting such that both agents are able 
              to have more apples in the long term. A more complex instantiation, like our motivating example, contains more 
              agents, with rewards based on social interactions, communal welfare, and varying levels of selfishness. Already, 
              this is closer to the real world. As complexity scales, simulations may approximate economics in self-contained 
              villages, then towns, cities, states, and so on. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The second axis represents the control that the Principal has on the simulation. In this case, potential control 
              is directly proportional to ability. While our motivating example is relatively complex, an advanced Principal 
              with a knowledge of game theory and high-level math would be able to fully ‚Äòsolve the game‚Äô by parameterizing the 
              simulation with the mathematically optimal tax rate. In a situation with an obscured or dynamic equilibrium, an 
              advanced Principal may have the ability to output adaptive code designed to produce parameterizations. An even more 
              advanced Principal may output neural network weights for a network designed to produce parameterizations. The relationship 
              between control and ability applies to inputs as well as outputs ‚Äî a more sophisticated Principal would be able to process 
              more sophisticated information from the agents within the simulation. Thus, as the ability of the Principal increases, the 
              potential for a more effective instantiation of Social Environment Design increases as well.

          <br>
          Clearly, we have steps to take in two directions ‚Äî simulating real-world complexity, and designing an incredibly advanced Principal. Really, 
          we have a marathon to run in two directions ‚Äî this distance represents a colossal gap between the technology that we have and the technology 
          that we need. Though this gap is colossal, the Colosseum stands tall two thousand years after its construction, and we‚Äôve heard that it wasn‚Äôt 
          built in a day. We foresee many implementations of SED, each better than the last. Here, we present a simplified outline what some of those 
          implementations may look like.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>SED v1</strong>:  Here, we may see a small population in an already-governed community, such as a neighborhood or a mobile home park, that are 
              looking to improve the place that they live. In this hypothetical, each member of the population donates some small sum of money, along 
              with the changes they wish to see ‚Äî perhaps a new park, or an after-school organization that looks after children before their parents 
              get home from work. The Principal will take into account their desires, allocate the money as it sees fit, and gauge the satisfaction of 
              the population. The Principal will continue to optimize for the satisfaction of the population over repeated monetary allocations, leading 
              to a happier population. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SED v2</strong>: In this case, we see a larger and more complex population, and a Principal tasked with more than just monetary 
              allocation. This may take the form of a larger town or city, in which the Principal deals with both monetary allocation, via taxes rather 
              than donations, and the drafting of legal policies. These legal policies may concern the local tax system itself, the operation of public 
              transport and infrastructure, and more ‚Äî the Principal would have responsibilities akin to the legislature of such a population.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SED v3</strong>: As the population and ability of the Principal increases, the possible instantiations for SED grow as well. 
              An advancement from SED v2 may be the utilization of SED within a state in the United States, or for a small small country. Of course, 
              this would be dependent on the success of SED v2, as well as the state of pertinent technology needed for a v3 Principal. This prerequisite 
              applies to each advancement ‚Äî SED v2 would happen only after the conclusive success of SED v1.

        <div>  We are under no illusion that this will be easy ‚Äî each of these steps represents a large technological and ideological jump. Furthermore, 
          we are acutely aware that SED will affect people beyond researchers and academics. Thus, every person reading this, regardless of skillsets or 
          familiarity with artificial intelligence, deserves a chance to contribute to this cause. With this in mind, we propose a framework, paralleling SED, 
          that will allow for the contribution of anybody and everybody who believes in Social Environment Design.</div>
