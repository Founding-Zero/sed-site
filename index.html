                Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government
                and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by
                introducing <strong>Social Environment Design</strong>, a general framework for the use of AI for
                automated
                policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice
                communities.
                The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and
                gives a
                direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We
                highlight
                key open problems for future research in AI-based policymaking. By solving these challenges, we hope to
                achieve
                various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.

          <div> Economic policy formulation is a domain fraught with complexity, with traditional economic models
            providing limited
            foresight into the outcomes of policy decisions. Policy-makers must not only understand the immediate
            implications
            of individual policies but also their aggregate and long-term effects. In addition, human policy-maker
            incentives
            are often not aligned with the interests of the general public, and may instead prioritize special interests
            or
            reelection. In light of this, AI-based approaches to policy design that can simulate economies and target
            different
            objectives, hold the potential for improved policy understanding and formulation.</div>

            <div>Figure 1: The proposed framework. The process begins with voting, where human or AI players report
              preferences on social welfare objectives to a
              voting mechanism (1). This defines an objective for the Principal, who designs a parameterized ùëÅ-player
              Partially Observable Markov Game.
              The players are the same as the voters. This POMG unfolds over several timesteps ùëá. Following the POMG,
              game state information is extracted
              to initiate a new round of voting, with the last POMG state used as the first game state of the new round.
              This whole process is repeated for
              ùúè timesteps.</div>

                In an era where AI is gaining increasing attention in governments, it is timely to understand its
                potential influence on future policy-making. Ideally, such a framework should satisfy the following
                desiderata:
              </div>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Alignment of policy-makers</strong> to the values of constituents, whilst ensuring fair and
                  equitable representation.</li>
                <li>Sufficient<strong> model expressivity</strong> to accurately represent the intricate governance
                  structures found in the real world, capturing the subtleties and variances of socio-economic
                  interactions.</li>
                <li>Balance expressiveness with <strong> with computational tractability</strong>, making it feasible to
                  scale to systems with a large number of agents.</li>
                <li>Build<strong> theoretical understanding,</strong> enabling systematic analysis and offering a new
                  lens
                  on complex economic models.</li>
              </ol>
              <div>
                Our work proposes a new framework, Social Environment Design, that lays out an agenda in making progress
                towards these desiderata.
                In our framework, illustrated in the figure above, we suggest addressing the concern of a misaligned
                policy-maker an AI-driven Principal policy-maker
                who seeks to achieve suggested policy goals, given by a voting mechanism. We capture the complexity of a
                general economic environment
                whilst maintaining computational tractability by modeling the economy as a Partially Observable Markov
                Game (POMG), which maintains a fixed
                observation space for each agent. Finally, we structure our framework as repeatedly finding Stackelberg
                Equilbria, enabling theoretical understanding
                by allowing reduction to simpler subproblems.

              Player agents observe a restricted view of their environment, and receive a mixed reward depending on the
              apples they collect and
              the apples their observable neighbors collect. The principal observes both an unrestricted view of the
              environment and the running
              totals of all the players‚Äô cumulative extrinsic rewards, where it collects tax and redistributes wealth on
              the cumulated rewards at
              the end of every tax period (50 timesteps), similar to Zheng et al. (2022). Rewards for the Principal are
              determined by the change
              in value of the objective it is currently assigned by agent votes.</div>

                  In order to give a motivating example for how preference elicitation for the principal in Social
                  Environment Design can be used to align
                  policy-maker incentives, we have created a Sequential Social Dilemma Game inspired by the Harvest
                  Game proposed in Perolat et al. (2017).
                  The game is illustrated in Figure 2. The aim in Harvest Game is to collect apples, with each apple
                  yielding a reward. If all apples in an
                  area are harvested, they never grow back. The dilemma arises when individual self-interest drives
                  rapid harvesting, which could permanently
                  deplete resources. Thus, agents must sacrifice personal benefit and cooperate for collective
                  well-being. One potential solution to this
                  dilemma is through the use of a central government that taxes and redistributes apples. Thus, we
                  have created a new game inspired by
                  Zheng et al. (2022) in which a principal designs tax rates on apple collection and players vote on
                  Utilitarian (productivity) vs.
                  Egalitarian (equality) objectives for the principal. As players interact within this evolving
                  environment, the principal faces the challenge
                  of crafting policies that balance immediate economic incentives with sustainability goals. In order
                  to achieve this, the principal must foster
                  cooperation among players, guiding them towards the Pareto-Efficient equilibrium that the players
                  have chosen. Preliminary results were promising,
                  but further analysis is warranted.

                <div> Our work proposes a generalized framework that has the potential to improve decision-making ‚Äî we
                  believe that further work will yield tangibly impactful positive results. However, we recognize
                  that its current level of abstraction may obscure its ultimate potential and application. Our
                  motivating example, while useful as a proof of concept, is clearly distant from real-world economic
                  systems. While we recognize the distance, we posit that both a game where agents harvest apples and
                  the NYSE lie on the same fundamental axis. In fact, we outline two natural axes that separate our
                  example from societally impactful instantiations of SED in the future.
                  <br><br>
                  Our axes: <strong>Simulation Complexity</strong> and <strong>Principal Control</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The first and more immediately apparent axis is the complexity of the simulation that the
                      Principal
                      is parameterizing. One of the simplest instantiations of the simulation would be two independent
                      agents
                      harvesting apples, each with the desire to have as many apples as possible. In this situation, an
                      optimal
                      parameterization from the Principal might one that discourages overharvesting such that both
                      agents are able
                      to have more apples in the long term. A more complex instantiation, like our motivating example,
                      contains more
                      agents, with rewards based on social interactions, communal welfare, and varying levels of
                      selfishness. Already,
                      this is closer to the real world. As complexity scales, simulations may approximate economics in
                      self-contained
                      villages, then towns, cities, states, and so on.

                      The second axis represents the control that the Principal has on the simulation. In this case,
                      potential control
                      is directly proportional to ability. While our motivating example is relatively complex, an
                      advanced Principal
                      with a knowledge of game theory and high-level math would be able to fully ‚Äòsolve the game‚Äô by
                      parameterizing the
                      simulation with the mathematically optimal tax rate. In a situation with an obscured or dynamic
                      equilibrium, an
                      advanced Principal may have the ability to output adaptive code designed to produce
                      parameterizations. An even more
                      advanced Principal may output neural network weights for a network designed to produce
                      parameterizations. The relationship
                      between control and ability applies to inputs as well as outputs ‚Äî a more sophisticated Principal
                      would be able to process
                      more sophisticated information from the agents within the simulation. Thus, as the ability of the
                      Principal increases, the
                      potential for a more effective instantiation of Social Environment Design increases as well.

                    Clearly, we have steps to take in two directions ‚Äî simulating real-world complexity, and designing
                    an
                    incredibly advanced Principal. Really,
                    we have a marathon to run in two directions ‚Äî this distance represents a colossal gap between the
                    technology that we have and the technology
                    that we need. Though this gap is colossal, the Colosseum stands tall two thousand years after its
                    construction, and we‚Äôve heard that it wasn‚Äôt
                    built in a day. We foresee many implementations of SED, each better than the last. Here, we present
                    a
                    simplified outline what some of those

                        <strong>SED v1</strong>: Here, we may see a small population in an already-governed community,
                        such as a neighborhood or a mobile home park, that are
                        looking to improve the place that they live. In this hypothetical, each member of the population
                        donates some small sum of money, along
                        with the changes they wish to see ‚Äî perhaps a new park, or an after-school organization that
                        looks
                        after children before their parents
                        get home from work. The Principal will take into account their desires, allocate the money as it
                        sees fit, and gauge the satisfaction of
                        the population. The Principal will continue to optimize for the satisfaction of the population
                        over repeated monetary allocations, leading
                        to a happier population.

                        Principal tasked with more than just monetary
                        allocation. This may take the form of a larger town or city, in which the Principal deals with
                        both monetary allocation, via taxes rather
                        than donations, and the drafting of legal policies. These legal policies may concern the local
                        tax
                        system itself, the operation of public

                        instantiations for SED grow as well.
                        An advancement from SED v2 may be the utilization of SED within a state in the United States, or
                        for a small small country. Of course,
                        this would be dependent on the success of SED v2, as well as the state of pertinent technology
                        needed for a v3 Principal. This prerequisite
                        applies to each advancement ‚Äî SED v2 would happen only after the conclusive success of SED v1.

          <div> Economic policy is a very complex field, and current economic models are only able to provide limited

            immediate implication of individual policies, but also their long-term effects and their interactions with

            <div>Figure 1: The proposed framework. In the Inner Simulation, there are several agents in an environment.
              You can imagine each agent as a simulated person, and the environment to be a video game. Each agent wants
              to do as well as possible in the game by maximizing their reward function. This is more complicated than
              it sounds ‚Äî you can imagine Pac-Man‚Äôs reward function being maximized by him eating more pellets! These
              agents ‚Äòplay‚Äô in the inner simulation for a while, until it becomes time to vote. At that point, they all
              report their preferences about the inner simulation ‚Äî in our Pac-Man example, Pac-Man‚Äôs preference might
              be for more pellets, and ghosts might report their preference to be able to move faster. All of the votes
              are considered, and an objective is outputted. We call this phase, where votes are considered and an
              objective is outputted, the Voting Mechanism. The objective is then passed to an AI, which we call the
              Principal. The Principal sees this objective and drafts new rules for the game ‚Äî we call these new rules a
              reparameterization. Then, the process begins anew! </div>

                When designing this framework, we wanted to try to satisfy several requirements.
              </div>
              <ol>
                <li>First, the framework should ensure the <strong>alignment </strong> of the Principal to the
                    values of the
                    agents in the Inner Simulation, with fair and equitable representation.</li>
                <li>We want to be able to <strong>accurately represent</strong> the complicated government and economic
                  structures that
                  we see in the real world today.</li>
                <li>We need the framework to be <strong>efficient</strong> ‚Äî it takes a lot of computer power
                  (expensive!) to run a
                  framework like this, and we want it to be able to scale to large scenarios. You can think of this like
                  fuel-efficiency ‚Äî we want our miles-per-gallon to be very high.</li>
                <li>Lastly, we want this framework to help <strong>develop our theoretical understanding</strong> of
                  complex economics. </li>
              </ol>
              <div>
                We argue that Social Environment Design does satisfy these requirements! <strong>Point 1: </strong>In
                our framework,
                illustrated in the figure above, we suggest addressing the concern of a misaligned policy-maker by using
                an AI-driven Principal policy-maker who seeks to achieve suggested policy goals, given by a voting
                mechanism, reducing misalignment between the policy-maker and the population that it represents.
                <strong>Point 2 and 3:</strong> Using some fancy math called Game Theory, we are able to create a
                complex environment, but still
                remain ‚Äòfuel-efficient‚Äô by hiding most of that environment from each player (just like you! Most of the
                world is hidden from you right now; you can‚Äôt see Antarctica from where you are). <strong>Point
                  4:</strong> By
                structuring our framework as repeated loops of the same process, we can reduce the larger economic
                problem into many smaller problems, which will enable us to develop better theoretical understanding of
                complex economics.

            <div>This image shows the Inner Simulation in a proof-of-concept example of Social Environment Design. Here,
              the agents find themselves amongst apple trees, and are able to harvest these apples. The reward function
              of each agent depends on how many apples the individual agent has picked (intrinsic reward) and how many
              apples the other agents have picked (extrinsic reward). At set intervals, the apples that have been
              accumulated by each agent are taxed. These taxed apples are redistributed to all of the agents. The
              Principal is able to reparameterize (draft new rules) the Inner Simulation by changing the tax tax rates.

                  Here, we present a motivating example for Social Environment Design, implemented for a small, simple
                  simulation called Harvest Game. The aim in Harvest Game is to collect apples, with each apple yielding
                  a reward. If all apples in an area are harvested, they never grow back. A dilemma arises when
                  individual self-interest drives rapid harvesting, which could permanently deplete resources. Thus, the
                  collective well-being of the population is dependent on individual agents sacrificing personal
                  benefit. One potential solution to this dilemma is through the use of a central government (or a
                  Principal!) that taxes and redistributes apples. In this example, players vote on whether they prefer
                  a utilitarian society (valuing overall productivity) or an egalitarian society (valuing equality). As
                  players interact within this evolving environment, the Principal faces the challenge of crafting
                  tax-rates that balance immediate economic incentives with sustainability goals. In order to achieve
                  this, the principal must foster cooperation among players, guiding them towards the type of society
                  that the players have chosen. The initial results of this example were promising, but further analysis

                <div> Our work proposes a generalized framework that has the potential to improve decision-making, and
                  we believe that further work will yield results that are impactful in the real world. However, we
                  understand that our framework is abstract, and so it may be difficult to see its future potential for
                  application; our motivating example, while useful as a proof of concept, is clearly distant from
                  real-world economic systems. While we recognize the distance, we posit that both a game where agents
                  harvest apples lies on the same fundamental axis as the New York Stock Exchange. In fact, we outline
                  two clear axes that separate our example from societally impactful instantiations of SED in the
                  future.
                  <br><br>
                  Our axes: <strong>Simulation Complexity</strong> and <strong>Principal Control</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The first and more immediately apparent axis is the complexity of the simulation (or real world
                      environment). As an example, one of the simplest instances of the simulation would be two
                      independent agents harvesting apples, each having a reward function that is maximized solely by
                      increasing their own apples. In this situation, the best rules drafted by the Principal might
                      discourage overharvesting of the apples so that both agents are able to have more apples in the
                      long term. A more complex instance, like our earlier motivating example, contains more agents,
                      with reward functions based on social interactions, communal welfare, and varying levels of
                      selfishness. Already, this is closer to the real world. As complexity scales, simulations may
                      approximate economics in self-contained villages, then towns, cities, states, and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The second axis represents the control that the Principal has on the simulation. In this case,
                      potential control is directly proportional to ability. In the last ten years, artificial
                      intelligence has advanced exponentially. However, there is still much, much progress to be made
                      throughout the field broadly. We are still far from the technology that would enable artificial
                      intelligence to play the role of Principal for even a small town. As we continue along this path
                      of advancement, however, the potential Principals will be able to effectively participate in more
                      real-world environments. </br>
                      While our motivating example is fairly complex, an advanced Principal with a knowledge of game
                      theory and high-level math would be able to fully ‚Äòsolve the game‚Äô by parameterizing the
                      simulation with the mathematically optimal tax rate. In a situation with an ever-changing
                      ‚Äòsolution‚Äô, an advanced Principal may have the ability to output adaptive code designed to produce
                      parameterizations. This relationship between control and ability applies to inputs as well as
                      outputs ‚Äî a more sophisticated Principal would be able to process more sophisticated information
                      from the agents within the simulation. Thus, as the ability of the Principal increases, the
                      effectiveness of the voting mechanism increases as well.

                    Clearly, we have steps to take in two directions ‚Äî simulating real-world complexity, and designing
                    an incredibly advanced Principal. Really, we have a marathon to run in two directions ‚Äî this
                    distance represents a colossal gap between the technology that we have and the technology that we
                    need. Though this gap is colossal, Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. We foresee many implementations of
                    SED, each better than the last. Here, we present a simplified outline what some of those
                    implementations may look like.

                      <li>
                        <strong>SED v1</strong>: Here, we may see a small population in an already-governed community,
                        such as a neighborhood or a mobile home park, that are
                        looking to improve the place that they live. In this hypothetical, each member of the population
                        donates some small sum of money, along
                        with the changes they wish to see ‚Äî perhaps a new park, or an after-school organization that
                        looks
                        after children before their parents
                        get home from work. The Principal will take into account their desires, allocate the money as it
                        sees fit, and gauge the satisfaction of
                        the population. The Principal will continue to optimize for the satisfaction of the population
                        over repeated monetary allocations, leading
                        to a happier population.

                      <li>
                        <strong>SED v2</strong>: In this case, we see a larger and more complex population, and a
                        Principal tasked with more than just monetary
                        allocation. This may take the form of a larger town or city, in which the Principal deals with
                        both monetary allocation, via taxes rather
                        than donations, and the drafting of legal policies. These legal policies may concern the local
                        tax
                        system itself, the operation of public
                        transport and infrastructure, and more ‚Äî the Principal would have responsibilities akin to the
                        legislature of such a population.

                      <li>
                        <strong>SED v3</strong>: As the population and ability of the Principal increases, the possible
                        instantiations for SED grow as well.
                        An advancement from SED v2 may be the utilization of SED within a state in the United States, or
                        for a small small country. Of course,
                        this would be dependent on the success of SED v2, as well as the state of pertinent technology
                        needed for a v3 Principal. This prerequisite
                        applies to each advancement ‚Äî SED v2 would happen only after the conclusive success of SED v1.
