              Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used to improve government
              and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research agenda towards this end by
              introducing <strong>Social Environment Design</strong>, a general framework for the use of AI for automated
              policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities. 
              The framework seeks to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives, and gives a 
              direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy through AI simulation. We highlight
              key open problems for future research in AI-based policymaking. By solving these challenges, we hope to achieve 
              various social welfare objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Introduction</h2>
        <div>  Economic policy formulation is a domain fraught with complexity, with traditional economic models providing limited 
          foresight into the outcomes of policy decisions. Policy-makers must not only understand the immediate implications 
          of individual policies but also their aggregate and long-term effects. In addition, human policy-maker incentives 
          are often not aligned with the interests of the general public, and may instead prioritize special interests or 
          reelection. In light of this, AI-based approaches to policy design that can simulate economies and target different 
          objectives, hold the potential for improved policy understanding and formulation.</div>

        <div>Figure 1: The proposed framework. The process begins with voting, where human or AI players report preferences on social welfare objectives to a 
          voting mechanism (1). This defines an objective for the Principal, who designs a parameterized ùëÅ-player Partially Observable Markov Game. 
          The players are the same as the voters. This POMG unfolds over several timesteps ùëá. Following the POMG, game state information is extracted
           to initiate a new round of voting, with the last POMG state used as the first game state of the new round. This whole process is repeated for 
          ùúè timesteps.</div>

          In an era where AI is gaining increasing attention in governments, it is timely to understand its potential influence on future policy-making. Ideally, such a framework should satisfy the following desiderata:
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Alignment of policy-makers</strong> to the values of constituents, whilst ensuring fair and equitable representation.</li>
          <li>Sufficient<strong> model expressivity</strong> to accurately represent the intricate governance structures found in the real world, capturing the subtleties and variances of socio-economic interactions.</li>
          <li>Balance expressiveness with <strong> with computational tractability</strong>, making it feasible to scale to systems with a large number of agents.</li>
          <li>Build<strong> theoretical understanding,</strong> enabling systematic analysis and offering a new lens on complex economic models.</li>
        </ol>
        <div>
          Our work proposes a new framework, Social Environment Design, that lays out an agenda in making progress towards these desiderata. 
          In our framework, illustrated in the figure above, we suggest addressing the concern of a misaligned policy-maker an AI-driven Principal policy-maker 
          who seeks to achieve suggested policy goals, given by a voting mechanism. We capture the complexity of a general economic environment
          whilst maintaining computational tractability by modeling the economy as a Partially Observable Markov Game (POMG), which maintains a fixed 
          observation space for each agent. Finally, we structure our framework as repeatedly finding Stackelberg Equilbria, enabling theoretical understanding 
          by allowing reduction to simpler subproblems.

          <div>Figure 2: An example of social environment design as an apple picking game, built with Melting Pot 2.0 (Agapiou et al., 2022). 
            Player agents observe a restricted view of their environment, and receive a mixed reward depending on the apples they collect and 
            the apples their observable neighbors collect. The principal observes both an unrestricted view of the environment and the running 
            totals of all the players‚Äô cumulative extrinsic rewards, where it collects tax and redistributes wealth on the cumulated rewards at
            the end of every tax period (50 timesteps), similar to Zheng et al. (2022). Rewards for the Principal are determined by the change
             in value of the objective it is currently assigned by agent votes.</div>

        <div>
          In order to give a motivating example for how preference elicitation for the principal in Social Environment Design can be used to align
          policy-maker incentives, we have created a Sequential Social Dilemma Game inspired by the Harvest Game proposed in Perolat et al. (2017). 
          The game is illustrated in Figure 2. The aim in Harvest Game is to collect apples, with each apple yielding a reward. If all apples in an 
          area are harvested, they never grow back. The dilemma arises when individual self-interest drives rapid harvesting, which could permanently 
          deplete resources. Thus, agents must sacrifice personal benefit and cooperate for collective well-being. One potential solution to this 
          dilemma is through the use of a central government that taxes and redistributes apples. Thus, we have created a new game inspired by 
          Zheng et al. (2022) in which a principal designs tax rates on apple collection and players vote on Utilitarian (productivity) vs. 
          Egalitarian (equality) objectives for the principal. As players interact within this evolving environment, the principal faces the challenge 
          of crafting policies that balance immediate economic incentives with sustainability goals. In order to achieve this, the principal must foster
          cooperation among players, guiding them towards the Pareto-Efficient equilibrium that the players have chosen. Preliminary results were promising,
           but further analysis is warranted.
